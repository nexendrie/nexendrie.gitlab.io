Nexendrie Project
=================

About
-----

The Nexendrie Project was started in April 2015 by Jakub Konečný. The ultimate goal is to create a browser-based medieval ages/renaissance fantasy game. Currently it is in closed beta stage. Homepage: https://nexendrie.cz Twitter: https://twitter.com/nexendrie

Along the way, some reusable parts were separated from the main repository into standalone packages (which can be downloaded via Composer).

Repositories
------------

Most of the project's repositories are hosted on both GitHub: https://github.com/nexendrie and GitLab: https://gitlab.com/nexendrie/ . Among the exceptions are the main project (which is a private repository on GitLab at the moment) and our common resources: https://gitlab.com/nexendrie/resources .

Used stuff
------

Our primary programming language is PHP. We use version 7.0 but most of our packages also run on 5.6. Our projects are powered by Nette Framework: https://nette.org/en/ . We heavily test our code with Nette Tester (improved by testbench from Martin Zlámal).
