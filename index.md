Nexendrie Project
=================

About
-----

The Nexendrie Project was started in April 2015 by Jakub Konečný. The ultimate goal is to create a browser-based medieval ages/renaissance fantasy game. Currently it is in closed beta stage. Homepage: https://nexendrie.cz

Along the way, some reusable parts were separated from the main repository into standalone packages.
